## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
After reading the comment from Grace, I have done several things below:
1. remove bootstrap. 
2. remove the h2s
3. make the 3 stats into an unordered list with 3 items inside

      I am going to do below:
4. wrap either the number or word in a span or strong tag
5. For the layout start mobile first.


### Continued development
Still continue to develop
